# Security Rules

This document outlines the security rules for Firestore and Cloud Storage.

## Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)

The Firestore security rules are designed to control access to the data in your database. The rules ensure that users can only read and write data that they are authorized to access. By default, the rules are restrictive to prevent unauthorized access.

## Storage Rules (`storage.rules`)

The Cloud Storage security rules protect your files from unauthorized access. These rules are configured to allow users to only upload and download files that are associated with their own data.
